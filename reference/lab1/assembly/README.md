This repo holds practice and experimental programs written in NASM assembly for
the x86 instruction architecture.

About

The projects in this repo are a combination of practice questions from the
[PCASM Tutorial](http://www.drpaulcarter.com/pcasm/) and my projects from
two semesters of Assembly taught at
[BMCC](http://www.bmcc.cuny.edu/j2ee/index.jsp). The school projects were all
ported from [MASM](http://www.masm32.com). The examples directory holds all the
supporting source and include files needed to follow the PCASM tutorial.

Environment

All projects were built using the instructions in the comments at the top of
each main asm file on a 32 bit Archlinux Virtualbox instance. The projects are
written in NASM but are executed by a C driver program as outlined in the PCASM
tutorial.

Requirements

* make
* nasm
* gcc
